Dissertation--Modularization-of-Large-Web-Applications
======================================================

Repository for the my master's dissertation (MIEIC/FEUP) entitled "Modularization of Large Web Applications" proposed by Blip

# Abstract
Research and Implement the modularization of an extremely large and highly transactional web application.

# Objectives and Expected Work
Modularization of applications is key to reduce the development cycles and increase time to market. The focus for this thesis is to research and deliver a technical architecture and implementation that enables modularization of an already existent application with an extremely large code base with more than 50 developers contributing to it on a daily basis. 

# Innovative Aspects
Modularization of applications in organizations with a very large developer community can be very challenging to accomplish and get right but as the potential to reduce intra-team dependencies and simplify the release train.
