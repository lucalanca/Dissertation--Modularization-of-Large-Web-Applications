# Abstract

Modularization of applications is key to reduce the development cycles and increase time to market. There are several architectural patterns, such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that promotes modularity in highly transactional, concurrent and scalable systems.

That being said, in the real world, sometimes there isn't enough time to develop a well-though future-predicting architecture. A common methodology in teams working on building innovative products (e.g. Startups), is to implement a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first, and add functionality over time. The problem with this approach is that architectural design changes on a in-production system are very hard to accomplish, primarely due to the fact that one must ensure a minimum down-time. Although there is a lot of literature in refactoring already existent code, architecture refactoring is somehow new to sofware engineering. 

The Betfair system is an interesting one to study. First, because it has suffered several architecture modifications over time since its beginning. Second, because its a system with huge scalability, consistency and availabily constraints. 

This master's thesis will focus on studying architecture refactoring of systems. It will hava as case study the Betfair system, where an architecture refactoring will be made by the introduction of SOA patterns (specifically Enterprise System Bus). It will provide insights to common problems in refactoring architecture of system and techniques and methods on how to achieve this.

<!-- # Context

Modularization of applications is key to reduce the development cycles and increase time to market. The focus for this thesis is to research and deliver a technical architecture and implementation that enables modularization of an already existent application with an extremely large code base with more than 50 developers contributing to it on a daily basis.
